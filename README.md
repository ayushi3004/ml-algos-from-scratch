# ml-algos-from-scratch
Popular ml algorithms implementation without 3rd party libs

Algorithms covered:

1: Implementing Stochastic Gradient Descent

2: Given set of expected and actual results, implement individual functions that calculate Precision, Recall & Accuracy metrics

3: Given a dataset that contains a corpus of emails - our goal is to implement a classifier to identify Spam vs Ham emails using Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. Include data cleaning, preprocessing & feature matrix construction.

4: Multi-class classification problem via Logistic Regression

5: Clustering algorithm

6. Implement a single layer FCN to produce vectors for words. The goal is to learn back-prop and the mechanics of it and then see how they fit in the context of word vectors.

7: WordVectors and their implementation

8. fasttext implementation
